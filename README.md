### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineering student at General Assembly currently working with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Eventually going to learn React, Node and Python. I'm constantly learning new technologies and love doing so. I also enjoy building PC's for gaming and creating music. Eventually I would love to find myself in a software engineering career where I can apply my passion into my work. Feel free to connect with me on any platform I'm on!
